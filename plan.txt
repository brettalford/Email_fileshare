Okay so the plan for this program is to create a system that allows you to email files (under the gmail limit) from your computer to any device
these fiels will be stored in  specified open folder partly for security reasons partly because its more manageable
there will be two maybe three basic commands
command 1: List files command will allo you to see the file directory so you can get the names of the files
command 2: Get (filename) which will enble you to select which file you want to have sent to you.
potential 3rd command: Push (filename) (with your file as an email attchment) this will upload that file to the shared
file folder. potential risk with this is it allows code to be injected but the benefit is it allows files to be uploaded
to your device easily.
possible command 3 security solution:require  password after Push (it Push 87952 (filename) (included attachment)) it isnt
the most advanced method of protection but should prevent random people from accessing data they dont hav the right to
this can actually be used for all 3 commands as a security measure

parts of progrm needed:
-function to check email for new messages
-function to read messages/determine unread vs read messages
-function to extract message info (sender,password,command,filename)
-function to check password
-function to download attachment if password checks out
-function to retrieve file names and content
-function to assemble message depending on push get or list(information,command)
-function to send message to user email

system will expect all info in subject line ie (Get 87952 example.txt)
