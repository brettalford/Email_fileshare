Prerequisites:
Currently set up to use gmail but that can be altered fairly easily
To set up this program you need three things
-A folder address to plug into root_folder (this will be where all your shared files sit)
-the address you want to be sending the information, a personal gmail address will work just fine
-an app password for the gmail account you wish to use, this required 2 factor authentication to get
-either use the default password or change it to one of your own

Usage Instructions:
There are 3 basic commands List,Get, and Push.
List (called by:List,password) returns an email showing you the file directory so you can see the names of everything youre working with
Get (called by:Get,password,filename.extension) retrieves the chosen file stored on your system, exact name must be used
Push (called by:Push,password,filename.extension  with a file attached to your message)downloads a file to the folder location

Everything you need to do in order to transfer files is have the program actively running and send these commands to the gmail account you have set up
the program is currently on a 30 second sleep timer so that it does not take up to0 many resources but the timer can be changed easily
